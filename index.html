			Lousie - a single mother living in San Francisco who spends her entire life runs away from her
			family - receives a call from her brother Mark - <b><em>Mom and Dad are dead</em></b>. 
			<br><br>She agrees to come back home and sell their home. The moment she walks in, 
			she realizes something seems off, especially the room filled with her mom's dolls.
			Louise is welcomed by the sight of Pupkin, her mother's favorite doll, sitting in a chair 
			in front of the TV, watching Home Shopping Network.
		<br><br>
			A song Louise hadn't thought of in years starts playing in her head: 
			<h3 class="block">
                <h3 class="red">
                <em><b>"Pupkin here! Pupkin here! Everybody laugh! Everybody cheer!"</b></em>
                </h3>
            </h3>
			...<br><br>"Pupkin was a red-and-yellow glove puppet with two stumpy fabric legs dangling down fron his front 
			and two little nubbin arms. His chalk-white plastic face had a big smiling mouth and a little pug nose, and 
			he looked out of the corners of his wide eyes like he was up to some kind of mischief. His mouth and eyes were
			outlined in thick black lines and he wore a bloodred bodysuit with a pointed hood and a yellow stomach."

	<div class="pupkin-details">
		Pupkin's favorite way to eliminate his rivals? - <em><b>mind control</b></em>
		<p class ="block">
			<em>Pupkin doesn't like this. No, no, no. That baby isn't good.<br><br>He makes everything
				different. It makes Pupkin angry. <br> It makes Pupkin so angry <br><br> Sometimes 
				Pupkin gets so angry <p class ="red"> Pupkin wants to do something bad </p>
			</em>
		</p>
		... <br><br> He finally stopped and she felt him settle just below her chin, pressing down
		on her throat, making it hard to swallow. <em>"... please ... please ... "</em> She had no 
		choice. She opened her eyes. Pupkin's maniacally grinning face stared into hers from two inches
		away. He had the same little black tongue, the same turned-up nose, the same chalk-white face,
		but something else looked out at her through those black-rimmed eyes. Something she couldn't 
		control, and Louise knew she was all alone in her room with something truly dangerous.
		<p class="block">
			<p class="red">
				<em><b>You're going to do what Pupkin says, </b></em> 
			</p>
			he told her, 
			<p class="red">
				<em><b>or Pupkin will hurt you</b></em>
			</p>

		<h3>When Louise finds out her parents have died, she dreads going home. She doesn’t want to 
			leave her daughter with her ex and fly to Charleston. She doesn’t want to deal with her family 
			home, stuffed to the rafters with the remnants of her father’s academic career and her mother’s 
			lifelong obsession with puppets and dolls. She doesn’t want to learn how to live without the 
			two people who knew and loved her best in the world. <br><br>

			Most of all, she doesn’t want to deal with her brother, Mark, who never left their hometown,
			gets fired from one job after another, and resents her success. Unfortunately, she’ll need his
			help to get the house ready for sale because it’ll take more than some new paint on the walls 
			and clearing out a lifetime of memories to get this place on the market.<br><br>
			
			But some houses don’t want to be sold, and their home has other plans for both of them ...</h3>
